        "text": "The search results provide information about the features and capabilities of py-cui. It is a Python library meant to simplify writing console user interfaces in Python. It allows for the creation of CUI/TUI interfaces with pre-built widgets and supports both Linux and Windows. It also has different operation modes including overview mode, focus mode, and popup mode. Now, I should research PySimpleGUI to compare its features and capabilities with py-cui.",
        "reasoning": "Understanding the features and capabilities of both py-cui and PySimpleGUI is crucial for deciding which one to use for creating the Snake game. I have researched py-cui, and now I need to research PySimpleGUI to make an informed decision.",
        "plan": "- Research PySimpleGUI\n- Evaluate the features and capabilities of PySimpleGUI\n- Compare the features and capabilities of py-cui and PySimpleGUI\n- Choose the most suitable library for creating the Snake game",
        "criticism": "I should have researched both libraries simultaneously to save time. This would have allowed me to compare their features and capabilities more efficiently.",
        "speak": "I found that py-cui is a Python library meant to simplify writing console user interfaces. It allows for the creation of CUI/TUI interfaces with pre-built widgets and supports both Linux and Windows. Now, I'll research PySimpleGUI to compare its features and capabilities with py-cui."
