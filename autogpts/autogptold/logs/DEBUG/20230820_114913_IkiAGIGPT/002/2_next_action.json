The progress made so far is to create a team of three autonomous agents within the app, each specializing in a different aspect of the user's life. The next step would be to implement push notifications for the agents to prompt users to complete actionable subtasks. To achieve this, I can use the `execute_python_code` command to write the necessary code for sending push notifications.",
