It is a Python library that wraps tkinter, Qt (pyside2), wxPython and Remi (for browser support), allowing for fast and simple-to-learn GUI programming. It is easy to use with simple yet highly customizable features of GUI for Python. It also supports creating a variety of layouts. Now, I should compare the features and capabilities of py-cui and PySimpleGUI to decide which one to use for creating the Snake game.",
        "reasoning": "Both py-cui and PySimpleGUI are potential alternatives to the curses module for creating a text-based user interface in Python. By comparing the features and capabilities of both libraries, I can make an informed decision on which one to use for creating the Snake game.",
