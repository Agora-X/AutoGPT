        "text": "The web search results suggest several alternatives to the curses module for creating a text-based user interface in Python. One of them is py-cui, which is a Python library meant to simplify writing console user interfaces. Another mentioned alternative is PySimpleGUI. I should look into these options more closely to determine which one would be the most suitable for creating the Snake game.",
        "reasoning": "The Snake game requires a text-based user interface, and since the curses module is not supported in the current environment, I need to find an alternative. Both py-cui and PySimpleGUI are potential alternatives, and I need to evaluate them to find the most suitable one.",
        "plan": "- Research py-cui and PySimpleGUI\n- Evaluate the potential alternatives\n- Choose the most suitable alternative for creating the Snake game",
        "criticism": "I should have been aware of the limitations of the curses module and had alternative options ready. This would have saved time and prevented the need for additional research.",
        "speak": "I found several alternatives to the curses module for creating a text-based user interface in Python. I'll research these options to find the most suitable one for creating the Snake game."
