Create a team of three autonomous agents within the app, each specializing in a different aspect of the user's life: personal fitness, mental wellness, and cooking/nutrition.\n3. Ensure each agent is capable of sending push notifications to the user, prompting them to complete actionable subtasks a few times each day in service of their long-term goals.\n4.
