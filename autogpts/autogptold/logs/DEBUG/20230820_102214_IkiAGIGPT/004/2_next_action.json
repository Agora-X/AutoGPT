        "plan": "- Develop a user-friendly, mobile-friendly web app using Langchain, Python, Pinecone, Tailwinds, CSS, and NextJS that allows users to translate their long-term goals into actionable subtasks.\n- Create a team of three autonomous agents within the app, each specializing in a different aspect of the user's life: personal fitness, mental wellness, and cooking/nutrition.\n- Ensure each agent is capable of sending push notifications to the user, prompting them to complete actionable subtasks a few times each day in service of their long-term goals.\n- Continuously improve the app based on user feedback and data analysis to ensure it effectively helps users improve their lives.\n- Maintain the highest standards of data privacy and security, ensuring that all user information is stored and processed securely.",
        "criticism": "I should have started developing the web app earlier to make progress towards the goals. I need to be more proactive in identifying the next steps.",
