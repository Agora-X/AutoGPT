The search results highlighted the importance of creating inclusive online experiences for neurodiverse users. The concept of neurodiversity refers to the infinite variation in human neurocognitive functioning, emphasizing that there is no standard for a healthy or normal brain. The symbol for neurodiversity is the mathematical symbol for infinity, reflecting its broad scope. The term neurodiversity is part of a movement to reduce the medicalisation of the experiences of people who are 'wired differently'. Designing for neurodiversity can attract and maintain talent, build stronger teams, and develop a competitive edge. There's a rising trend for supporting neurodiversity in the workplace in 2023."
