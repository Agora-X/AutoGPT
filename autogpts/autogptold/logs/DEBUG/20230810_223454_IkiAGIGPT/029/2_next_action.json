        "text": "The output of the 'echo $PATH' command does not include the path to the Node.js binaries. This suggests that Node.js was not successfully added to the PATH. I'll need to find a way to add Node.js to the PATH that persists across shell sessions.",
        "reasoning": "Adding Node.js to the PATH is necessary to use the 'node' and 'npm' commands. The 'export' command only adds Node.js to the PATH for the current shell session, which is why the 'npm' command is not found.",

        "criticism": "I should have verified if Node.js was in the PATH before attempting to configure npm. This would have saved time and avoided the error.",
